\section{Conclusion}
We present an assembly program which utilizes insertionsort to sort up to 16-bit numbers.
From the testing results we can safely assume that the program works as expected and behaves accordingly, based on the times we can easily see that the algorithm runs in $O(n^2)$ time.
our challenges were to implement memory correctly and to access them correctly in the in the heap, and unfortunately the lack of resources online on assembly didn't help either.
