\section{Conclusion}
We present an assembly program which utilizes insertionsort to sort up to 16-bit numbers from an input file, the result of which is given back in the same format to stdout.
Testing has has made us confident that the sorting is performed correctly, and the testing shows a time usage growth that appears to be quadratic, as expected of the algorithm used, although the clarity of which is diluted by overhead elements of the program.
