\begin{description}[leftmargin=1em, style=nextline]
\item [\texttt{network\_layer\_allowed\_to\_send}] Signals the network layer that it can send a piece of data.
Here the network layer should make sure the \texttt{from\_network\_layer\_queue}
contains at least one element, after which it can signal \texttt{network\_layer\_ready},
which means that the network layer has prepared at least one element in the queue.

\item [\texttt{network\_layer\_ready}] This signal signals to the link layer that the network layer has prepared an element to be sent in the
  \texttt{from\_network\_layer\_queue} queue and that it should be sent now.

\item [\texttt{data\_for\_network\_layer}]
This signal signals to the network layer that the
\texttt{for\_network\_layer\_queue} contains a data element for it to take care of. (a data element has been received)
